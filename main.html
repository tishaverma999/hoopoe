<ol><b>
<li>Ask for parental assistance most of the time.</li>
<li>We should never give personal information online without our parents' permission like last name,home address,school name,or telephone number.</li>
<li>We should not include personal information like last name or date of birth in screen name.</li>
<li>We should create strong passwords with atleast 8 characters which should be a combination of lowercase,uppercase,special symbols and digits.</li>
<li>We should not share our password with anyone but our parents and we should set it only after consulting our parents. When we use a public computer we should make sure to log out of all tabs before leaving.</li>
<li>We should not post photos or videos online without our parents' permission. </li>
<li>We should not meet any online friend unless we have our parents' permission.</li>
<li> We should not buy online through online ads without consulting our parents as some ads just try to trick us by telling us that we have won something though it is just a way to get our private information. </li>
<li>We should not download any email from someone our parents or we don't know as emails often contain viruses.</li>
<li>We should not send or respond to mean or insulting msgs.If someone sends us an insulting message we should talk to our parents or some teacher at school. </li>
<li>Many social networking websites have minimum age requirements to sign up. These requirements are there to protect us so we should give our correct age. </li>
<li>We should talk to our librarian,teacher or parent about safe and accurate websites for research.</li>
<li> We should not plagarize i.e if we use online information , we should write from where we took that information and not show it as our own creation. </li>
